        <h1><b>Overview:</b></h1> <br>
        <p>Hamley’s is the world's oldest toy retailer . While going through its website I felt there was a room for improvement in the UI so I took up the challenge and redesigned it to make it look more organized and user friendly </p>
        <h1><b>Design process:</b></h1><br>

        <br><br>
        <h1><b>Reasearch And Understandings</b></h1> <br><br>
        <p>The website followed a theme but there is inconsistency overall. The website needed to be de cluttered for the user to navigate through the website easily.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2><br><br>
        <h3>1. Firstcry.com</h3><br>
        <p>a. The <b>target audience</b> of the website is similar to Hamley’s. <br><br>
         b. The <b>UI</b> for the website is better but it is still distracting all the areas demand for equal amount of attention. <br><br>
         c. There are too many items on the navigation bar. </p><br><br>
         <h3>2. Funcorp.com</h3><br>
         <p>a. The <b>target audience</b> of the website is similar to Hamley’s. <br><br>
            b. The <b>UI</b> is cluttered as all the different brands having different colors are displayed on the center of the front page which makes it look cluttered <br><br>
            c. The <b>UX</b> of the website is similar to Hamley’s website. </p><br><br>
        <h2>User Flow:</h2><br>
        <p>a. After Conducting user interviews and analyzing them i found that there is no major issues with the UX of the website except there was no rating section available  <br><br>
            b. Almost all the users found the UI very cluttered and uneasy to browse through </p>
        <img src="hamleypeps.jpeg" alt="reviews"><br><br>
        <h2>Design Principles not followed</h2><br><br>
        <p>a. Hierarchy <br><br>
            b. Consistency <br><br>
            c. Accessibility</p><br><br>
        <h2>Outcome of research:</h2><br><br>
        <p>a. Overwhelming home page <br><br>
            b. Many tabs on Navigation bar <br><br>
            c. Inconsistent fonts <br><br>
            d. Design principles not followed</p><br><br>
        <h1>Goal</h1><br><br>
        <p>a. To simplify the homepage <br><br>
           b. To organize the navigation bar <br><br>
           c. To make the buttons uniform </p><br><br>
        <h1>Ideation</h1><br><br>
        <p>My major Goal was to make the text legible but to keep the essence of the website same so i stuck with the original color theme of the website. 
            Before designing i created a mood board for the website.</p1><br><br>
